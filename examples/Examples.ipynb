    "## Purpose\n",
    "The primary purpose of this notebook is to provide users with practical examples and detailed instructions on how to utilize pyPolyMesher effectively. We will explore different domains and scenarios to demonstrate the versatility of the library. The notebook contains code snippets and explanations for each domain, covering structured and unstructured mesh generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this Notebook Contains\n",
    "This notebook is structured into sections, each dedicated to a specific example. In the following sections, you will find:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structured Mesh Generation: Demonstrating the generation of structured meshes.\n",
    "- Unstructured Mesh Generation: Creating meshes using specified or randomly distributed points.\n",
    "- Additional Configurations: Special cases or scenarios for specific domains, such as fixed points or unique features.\n",
    "- Creation of a custom domains: A step-by-step guide on how to create new custom domains\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the examples in this notebook, you can learn how to apply pyPolyMesher to your own projects and mesh generation tasks. Let's dive into the world of polygonal mesh generation with **pyPolyMesher**!"

    "**MBB Domain**: In structural engineering and topology optimization, the MBB (Material-Based Beam) domain is a specific type of design domain used to optimize the configuration of beams. Beams are structural elements primarily subjected to bending loads, and MBB domain topology optimization aims to find the optimal material distribution within the beam design domain. The objective is to maximize the beam's strength and stiffness while minimizing its weight. By default, the MBB domain is defined as a rectangle from (0,0) to (3,1).\n",
